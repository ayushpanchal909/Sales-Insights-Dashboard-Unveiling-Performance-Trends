## sales-insight-dashboard-project

In my BI project, I brought in data from an SQL database including customer, market, product, and transaction information. After cleaning the data and adding important DAX measures and calculated columns, I connected the tables logically. I then created a dashboard which displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales revenue and total sales quantity. The dashboard also includes a slicer that lets users filter data by year and month. Additionally, there are bar charts illustrating sales revenue and sales quantity based on market names. The dashboard highlights the top 5 products and top 5 customers as well. Lastly, a line chart captures the revenue trend over time. The goal of this dashboard is to present a clear and concise overview of sales performance and trends using straightforward visuals and filters.
